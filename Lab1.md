### Task 1 - Learning basic git commands
I ran through the provided tutorial and finished it.  The tutorial provided a mock repository with a command line that taught me several different commands that are used to edit and finalize files that are in a repository.

Here is a screenshot of the "certificate" of completion.

### Task 2 - Creating a github account
I didn't have a GitHub account until today.  I created one, and the username is "alpha1693".

### Task 3 - Ten Criteria of Open Source Definition
When most people hear "open source", they think it just means that the source code for certain software is available to the public.  While this is true, there is a lot more to the definition of open source.  Open source refers to software that has its entire source code readily available, modifiable, and redistributable by anyone who wishes to make reasonable changes to said software. 

Take a look at many of popular examples of open source software: Mozilla Firefox, Google Chromium, and the Linux kernel.  The source code is not only available, but the software has terms in its license that allows anyone to make changes to it and redistribute the modified software freely, as long as they give credit to the original authors.  We see examples of these "derived" works in software such as Tor Browser (a privacy-intensive distribution of Mozilla Firefox) and all the distributions of operating systems that use the Linux kernel (Ubuntu, Fedora, RedHat, etc.).

"Readily available" refers to code that is in its original form to perform its function.  Therefore, published code that is "packed", "obfuscated", or full of "garbage" is not necessarily open source.
The "HackedTeam" repository on GitHub, while containing the complete source code of a company's software, is not an example of "open source", as it was stolen from a private company and published without their permission.

### Task 4 - How to Answer Questions in a Helpful Way
Bring yourself to their level: don't assume that everyone inherently understands what you're doing.  Someone might actually be confused, and answering their question thoroughly can be an important learning experience to the asker!

Stay grounded: this goes along with the last *tip*; don't try and make the asker look dumb by asserting some esoteric facts on them.  Take it more like a community approach, keep helping others and making people smarter.
