### Task 1 - Read the article

Think of "free software" in terms of freedom, not price (software that is only free in terms of price is known as "freeware").  You have the freedom to do whatever you want to the free software, including running, disassembling, modifying, and redistributing it.

### Task 2 and 3 - Importance of software licenses

Software licenses clearly define the rights assigned to end users by the content creator.  It is important that intellectual property creators use a license with software so they have control over what can be done with their creation.  Without a license, it is assumed that all rights are reserved to the content creator.  It restricts all forms of use to the author of the software, which means only the authors can distribute it and make changes to it.  

There are several scenarios in which not having a license (a.k.a "all rights reserved") can be detrimental.
Think of a software that a lot of people use (Adobe Reader, Google Chrome, etc).  Every once in a while, hackers (whether professional or criminal) may find an exploitable vulnerability that allows arbritary malicious code to run on an end user's computer.  

Now suppose that the licenses of these popular softwares are suspended.  It becomes entirely up to the content creators to come up with a fix to the software, as "disassembling" and "debugging" the flawed software is now prohibited with the "all rights reserved" statement.  Security researchers are no longer able to actively find more potential bugs or help patch existing ones, allowing criminals (who don't care about licenses) to find them and exploit these "zero day" vulnerabilities.  

Whether or not software is free or for profit, a license should always be included, so that users are aware of their rights and that content creators don't accidentally restrict potentially helpful rights that can improve their software.
