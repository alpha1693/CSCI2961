### Task: Finding and correcting error

This section discusses the efforts made in correcting a minor grammatical error in the FreeBSD Developer's Handbook.
This error was located on the "Kernel Debugging", Chapter 10, Section 1.

"Several types of kernel crash dumps are available: full memory dumps, which hold the complete contents of physical memory, minidumps, which hold only memory pages in use by the kernel (FreeBSD  6.2 and higher), and textdumps, which hold captured scripted or interactive debugger output (FreeBSD 7.1 and higher)."

After the colon, the sentence should have read "full memory dumps, which hold the complete contents of physical memory; minidumps, which hold ...; and textdumps, which hold captured ..."

While there were several little comma based errors in the handbook, this one was particularly confusing because it was fusing two list items together.
